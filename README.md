# Popup-Box

Introduction
When creating the design of a web page, one of the most important things to be into consideration is user interactivity. A good example of user interactivity is the Modal box.

A modal box mostly appears as a message box in the Browser based on an action performed by a user. The modal box comes in different forms and shapes which includes the Alert box, Flash notification box, Dialog box, Lightbox. Etc.

The unique feature of the modal box is the fact that it disables the main window in the browser but keeps it visible, with the modal window showing as a child window in front of the web page.

Some of the important cases for using a modal in an application include:

Showing warnings for a certain course of action that may be irreversible.
Flash notifications on a new piece of information.
Increase in user interaction and engagement.
Modals have their disadvantages too, in that:

They can interrupt a user workflow.
They immediately demand the attention of the user.
They disable the contents in the background, which could be frustrating in some cases.
Now let us get started with the creation of the modals.
